    @interface YSKInitializer
    @brief The interface to a single-use initializer.
    @details Initialization is an internal process performed by SpeechKit to initialize its internals.

    Initialization may imply reading from persistent storage, netwroking communications and as the result take significant amount of time. A special class {@link YSKInitializer} introduced to allow user to perform the initialization in the context suitable for that.

    In the current implementation, it sends a request to the server and gets some parameters and configurations (such as confidence thresholds) that will be used during recognition later.

    The {@link YSKInitializer} class is designed to carry out a single initializer and may not be reused (for whatever reason).

    The {@link YSKInitializer} object manages the overall initialization, which mostly includes network communications.

    @note SpeechKit shall be initialized via {@link YSKSpeechKit::configureWithAPIKey:} before creating {@link YSKInitializer} objects.
